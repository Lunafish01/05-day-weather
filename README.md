# 05-day-weather

## Description

- Using an open weather API, I was able to create a weather app that showed the weather forecast for specific cities and locations searched.

- The open weather API was also used to create a 5 day weather forecast to show the date and weather for the next 5 days in the specifically searched location.

- I styled the page using fundamental CSS rules and as well as setting the font family to 'Roboto' using a Google Fonts Library 

## Set-Backs

- I did run into some issues trying to build out the JavaScript for the 5 day weather forecast, as it will not load to the page when searching the speicifally requested location, although the current weather function does work

- Before I could complete the application, I was unable to get the local storage to save the users search history.


## Acceptance Criteria

- GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
- WHEN I search for a city
- THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
- WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
- THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
- WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
- THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
- WHEN I click on a city in the search history
- THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
